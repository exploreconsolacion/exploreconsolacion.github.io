            Consolacion was a component barangay first founded in 1871 with a population of 14,248. Before this, it was only a barrio 
            of the municipality of Mandaue. The barrio, formerly named "Kampi-ig" named after a kind of crab living in mangroves, which 
            was abundant in the area, became a separate town in 1871. However, in 1902 and 1903, unable to maintain its status as an 
            independent municipality, it reverted to Mandaue.

                        In 1920, Consolacion was again made an independent municipality after a petition was accepted by the governor. 
                        So grateful were the townspeople to the Cebuano governor that they named their new town after his daughter – 
                        Consolacion – and they also chose San Narciso as their patron saint, the namesake of the governor's wife, 
                        Narcisa.

                also destroyed by a typhoon in 1892. A third one was built just before World War II, on its current site.

                        The present municipal hall is already the third one. The first was destroyed by the typhoon of 1892. 
                        The second one was also destroyed, by the Japanese during World War II. Today, Consolacion is a robust 
                        residential urban municipality with a vigorous economy, providing a place to live for people employed in 
                        the neighboring cities of Mandaue, Lapu-Lapu and Cebu.
