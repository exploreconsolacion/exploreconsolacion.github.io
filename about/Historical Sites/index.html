            </h2>
            <p class="text-base leading-none">
                Established in 1872, this parish is dedicated to San Narciso, chosen as the patron saint in honor of the wife of the 
                Spanish Governor who approved Consolacion’s establishment as a municipality. The original structure was made of nipa 
                and bamboo but has undergone reconstruction and modernization. It remains a center of religious activity and cultural 
                heritage in the municipality.

                This site marks the location of the first municipal building of Consolacion, built in 1871 out of nipa and bamboo. 
                The structure symbolized the town's independence after being recognized as a municipality. Although the original 
                building was destroyed in 1888 and replaced by modern iterations, the location remains a significant part of Consolacion’s 
                heritage. The current Municipal Hall, standing nearby, continues to serve as the town’s center of governance.
